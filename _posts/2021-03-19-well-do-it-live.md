When building products, it's normally best to work until you get things right. To build, to iterate, to refine, and then _finally_ to publish. That iteration polishes the roughly-chiseled idea into a smooth stone.

But, this isn't a product. This is just a personal website. So I'm going to publish it, default templates and all, just to call it done. Then I can do the refinement in public, and avoid bearing the weight of unfinished stone.

So, we'll do it live.
